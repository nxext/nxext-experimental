# Angular NGC vite plugin

This plugin was develop for prototyping. This is no longer maintained. If you want a NGC full application complier that works in Vite then feel free to still use this version. Feel free to create PR to fix any issues.

The future was deemed away from full application compiling to a file by file a pure Vite/SWC/ESBuild way of working
